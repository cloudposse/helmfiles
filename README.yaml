  Helmfiles is a comprehensive distribution of declarative [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) chart invocations. It makes it really easy to get up and running with a full stack of fully integrated apps for Kubernetes using [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile). It's also compatible with `helmfile.d`. 
  
  Pull Requests are welcome!

usage: |-

  Install the latest release of `helmfile` from the [helmfile releases](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/releases) page.

  Alternatively, we also distribute `helmfile` as an [alpine package](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

  Add the cloudposse alpine repository.

  ```
  # Install the cloudposse alpine repository
  ADD https://apk.cloudposse.com/ops@cloudposse.com.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
  RUN echo "@cloudposse https://apk.cloudposse.com/3.8/vendor" >> /etc/apk/repositories
  ```

  Install `helmfile` from the repository.

  ```
  RUN apk add helmfile
  ```


  ### Docker

  We distribute a docker image with all helmfiles. Use a multi-stage build to include them.

  ```
  FROM cloudposse/helmfiles:latest as helmfiles

  COPY --from helmfiles /helmfile.d/ /conf/helmfiles.d/
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** we recommend pinning `cloudposse/helmfiles` to a specific release rather than using `latest`

  ### Git
  
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:cloudposse/helmfiles.git
  ```

  ### Configuration

  Define a `helmfile.yaml` which includes the releases you wish to support. Specify all releases in the order in which they should get installed.

  Here's an example of a [`helmfile.yaml`](helmfile.yaml):

  ```
  # Ordered list of releases. 
  helmfiles:
    - "helmfile.d/prometheus-operator.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/cluster-autoscaler.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/kiam.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/external-dns.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/kube-lego.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/nginx-ingress.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/kube-prometheus.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/grafana.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/heapster.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/dashboard.yaml"
    - "helmfile.d/portal.yaml"
  ```
