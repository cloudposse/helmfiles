description: |-
  Helmfiles is a comprehensive distribution of declarative [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) chart invocations. It makes it really easy to get up and running with a full stack of fully integrated apps for Kubernetes using [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile).

  Pull Requests are welcome!

usage: |-

  Install the latest release of `helmfile` from the [helmfile releases](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/releases) page.

  Alternatively, we also distribute `helmfile` as an [alpine package](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

  Add the cloudposse alpine repository.

  ```
  # Install the cloudposse alpine repository
  ADD https://apk.cloudposse.com/ops@cloudposse.com.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
  RUN echo "@cloudposse https://apk.cloudposse.com/3.8/vendor" >> /etc/apk/repositories
  ```

  Install `helmfile` from the repository.

  ```
  RUN apk add helmfile
  ```


  ### Docker

  We distribute a docker image with all helmfiles. Use a multi-stage build to include them.

  ```
  FROM cloudposse/helmfiles:latest as helmfiles

  COPY --from=helmfiles /helmfiles /conf/helmfiles/
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** we recommend pinning `cloudposse/helmfiles` to a specific release rather than using `latest`

  ### Git

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:cloudposse/helmfiles.git
  ```

  ### Configuration

  Define a `helmfile.yaml` which includes the releases you wish to support. Specify all releases in the order in which they should get installed.
