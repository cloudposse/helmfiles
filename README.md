# Helmfiles [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/build?repoOwner=cloudposse&repoName=helmfiles&branch=master&pipelineName=helmfiles&accountName=cloudposse&type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/pipelines/helmfiles/builds) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/helmfiles.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Helmfiles is a comprehensive distribution of declarative [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) chart invocations. It makes it really easy to get up and running with a full stack of fully integrated apps for Kubernetes using [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile). It's also compatible with `helmfile.d`. 

Pull Requests are welcome!
