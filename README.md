# Helmfiles [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/build?repoOwner=cloudposse&repoName=helmfiles&branch=master&pipelineName=helmfiles&accountName=cloudposse&type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/pipelines/helmfiles/builds) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/helmfiles.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Helmfiles is a comprehensive distribution of declarative [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) chart invocations. It makes it really easy to get up and running with a full stack of fully integrated apps for Kubernetes using [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile).

Pull Requests are welcome!

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).













## Usage


Install the latest release of `helmfile` from the [helmfile releases](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/releases) page.

Alternatively, we also distribute `helmfile` as an [alpine package](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

Add the cloudposse alpine repository.

```
# Install the cloudposse alpine repository
ADD https://apk.cloudposse.com/ops@cloudposse.com.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
RUN echo "@cloudposse https://apk.cloudposse.com/3.8/vendor" >> /etc/apk/repositories
```

Install `helmfile` from the repository.

```
RUN apk add helmfile
```


### Docker

We distribute a docker image with all helmfiles. Use a multi-stage build to include them.

```
FROM cloudposse/helmfiles:latest as helmfiles

COPY --from helmfiles /helmfiles/ /conf/helmfiles/
```

**IMPORTANT:** we recommend pinning `cloudposse/helmfiles` to a specific release rather than using `latest`

### Git

```
git clone git@github.com:cloudposse/helmfiles.git
```

### Configuration

Define a `helmfile.yaml` which includes the releases you wish to support. Specify all releases in the order in which they should get installed.

Here's an example of a [`helmfile.yaml`](helmfile.yaml):

```
# Ordered list of releases. 
helmfiles:
  - "helmfiles/prometheus-operator.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/cluster-autoscaler.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/kiam.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/external-dns.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/kube-lego.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/nginx-ingress.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/kube-prometheus.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/grafana.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/heapster.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/dashboard.yaml"
  - "helmfiles/portal.yaml"
```
