# Helmfiles [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/build?repoOwner=cloudposse&repoName=helmfiles&branch=master&pipelineName=helmfiles&accountName=cloudposse&type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/pipelines/helmfiles/builds) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/helmfiles.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Helmfiles is a comprehensive distribution of declarative [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) chart invocations. It makes it really easy to get up and running with a full stack of fully integrated apps for Kubernetes using [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile). It's also compatible with `helmfile.d`. 

Pull Requests are welcome!

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage


## Docker

We distribute a docker image with all helmfiles. Use a multi-stage build to include them.

```
FROM cloudposse/helmfiles:latest as helmfiles

COPY --from helmfiles /helmfile.d/ /conf/helmfiles.d/
```

**IMPORTANT:** we recommend pinnging to a release rather than using `latest`

Then define a `helmfile.yaml` which includes the releases you wish to support.

Here's an example of a [`helmfile.yaml`](helmfile.yaml)
```
# Ordered list of releases. 
releases:
  - "helmfile.d/prometheus-operator.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/cluster-autoscaler.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/kiam.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/external-dns.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/kube-lego.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/nginx-ingress.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/kube-prometheus.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/grafana.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/heapster.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/dashboard.yaml"
  - "helmfile.d/portal.yaml"
```
